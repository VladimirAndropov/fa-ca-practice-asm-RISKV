## Workshop

#### Outline

* Using RISC-V 64-bit instructions to simulate vector operations

#### Examples

* [add_vector.s](add_vector.s)

_NOTE_:
The `ld` and `sd` instructions are 64-bit load and store correspondingly.
They are available in the 64-bit version of RISC-V and 64-bit mode of RARS.
To enable 64-bit mode in RARS, tick the checkbox in the `Setting | 64-bit` menu item.
This will make all general-purpose registers 64-bit wide.
The `ld` and `sd` instructions work in the same way as `lw` and `sw`,
the only difference is the data size that becomes 64 bits (or 8 bytes).
See the "Chapter 7. RV64I Base Integer Instruction Set" in the [RISC-V instruction set manual](
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/latest) for details.

#### Tasks

* Write a program that inputs an integer value `N`, inputs 2 matrices of size 4 * `N`,
  adds the two matrices, and prints the resulting matrix. Each element of a matrix is a byte value.
  Elements of the matrices are added by `4`, to simulate vector operations.
  _Hint:_ Use the `lw` and `sw` instructions to load and store 4 elements at once.
