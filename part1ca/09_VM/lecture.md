# Virtual Memory

## Lecture

Slides ([PDF](CA_Lecture_09.pdf), [PPTX](CA_Lecture_09.pptx)).

#### Outline

* Virtual memory and physical memory
* Virtual and physical addresses
* Address translation and page table
* Translation lookaside buffer (TLB)

## Workshop


#### Tasks

1. Consider a virtual memory system that can address a total of 2<sup>50</sup> bytes.
   You have unlimited hard drive space, but are limited to 2 GB of semiconductor (physical) memory.
   Assume that virtual and physical pages are each 4 KB in size.
   * How many bits is the physical address?
   * What is the maximum number of virtual pages in the system?
   * How many physical pages are in the system?
   * How many bits are the virtual and physical page numbers?
   * How many page table entries will the page table contain?
